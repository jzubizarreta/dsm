DSM is a novel approach to monocular SLAM. It is a fully direct system that estimates the camera trajectory and a consistent global map. Is is able to detect and handle map point reobservations when revisiting already mapped areas using the same photometric model and map points. We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the [EuRoC dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) and with custom videos. We also provide an optional GUI for 3D visualization of the system results.

## 2. Installation
We tested DSM int two different system configurations: **Ubuntu 18.04** and **Windows 10** (VS15 and VS17). It should be easy to compile in other platforms. See below for experimental **macOS** support. The library requires at least C++11.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jzubizarreta/dsm.git
```

### 2.1 Required Dependencies

#### Eigen3

We use [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for almost any mathematical operation. 
	
Install with
	
```sh
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

#### OpenCV

We use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to manipulate images (read/write/display) and to bootstrap the monocular system. Feel free to implement those functionalities with your prefered library, if you want to get rid off Opencv. 
	
Install with
	
```sh
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

#### Ceres Solver

We use [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org) to perform the photometric bundle adjustment. In addition to the standard installation process, we generate a custom template specialization corresponding to our Schur structure, which speeds up the Schur elimination step. This is an optional step that can be skipped.
	
```sh
git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver
```
	
Ceres dependencies:
	
```sh
# glog & gflags
sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev

# BLAS & LAPACK
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

# SuiteSparse
sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
```
		
Generate the custom template specialization (optional):

```sh
cp ./dsm/thirdparty/Ceres/generate_template_specializations.py ./ceres-solver/internal/ceres/
python2 ceres-solver/internal/ceres/generate_template_specializations.py
```

Install with
	
```sh
cd ceres-solver
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install	
```

### 2.2 Optional Dependencies

#### Qt

We use [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) for GUI and visualization. Although Qt is required to compile the whole project in the current version, it is easy to remove it. DSM does not depend on Qt. All the code related with Qt is in the `QtVisualizer` folder. Feel free to implement your own version of `IVisualizer` and replace the current visualizer `QtVisualizer`.

Install with

```sh
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
```

### 2.3 DSM build

Now we are ready to build DSM. Execute:

```sh
cd ../../dsm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

This will compile two libraries `libdsm.so` and `libQtVisualizer.so` at **lib** folder, which can be linked from external projects. It will also create two executables `EurocExample` and `VideoExample` at **bin** folder to run DSM in the EuRoC dataset and with custom videos respectively.

### 2.4 macOS

Support for macOS is experimental and not extensively tested, but in principle DSM including the GUI should be functional.

External dependencies on macOS can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew install cmake eigen opencv ceres-solver qt
```

From this point, you can follow the instructions above for *2.3 DSM build*.

**Note**: In some cases, the Qt5 installation location is not automatically found and you need to specify the modules manually to cmake with

```sh
cmake -DQt5Core_DIR="$(brew --prefix qt5)/lib/cmake/Qt5Core" -DQt5Widgets_DIR="$(brew --prefix qt5)/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets" -DQt5OpenGL_DIR="$(brew --prefix qt5)/lib/cmake/Qt5OpenGL" ..
```

## 3. Usage

### 3.1 Calibration format
DSM requires the geometric calibration of the camera as an input. Currently it uses the radial-tangential model (`camera_type` = `radtan`) or the fisheye model (aka Kannala-Brandt 4, aka pinhole-equidistant) (`camera_type` = `equidistant`) of OpenCV. However, it should be easy to add new camera models. Take a look at `Unidistorter.h`.

The calibration file has the format

```
camera_type
fx fy cx cy other parameters
in_width in_height
out_width out_height 
```

It is also possible to use higher order distortion models. You have to add the additional distortion coefficients using the OpenCV order. If no distortion coefficients are provided, they are assumed to be zero. Examples can be found in `Examples/EurocData` and `Examples/TUMVIData`.

### 3.2 EuRoC Example

1. Download a sequence (ASL format) from [https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets).

2. Extract the sequence in a folder `<SEQ_FOLDER>`.

3. Run the executable with the following arguments

```sh
./EurocExample <IMAGE_FOLDER> <TIMESTAMPS_FILE> <CALIB_FILE> <SETTINGS_FILE>
```

where 

   * `<IMAGE_FOLDER>` Folder containing the images of the sequence.

   * `<TIMESTAMPS_FILE>` File containing the image timestamps for that specific sequence.

   * `<CALIB_FILE>` File with the geometric calibration of the camera.

   * (Optional) `<SETTINGS_FILE>` File with the system settings. If it is not provided, internal default values are used.

The `<IMAGE_FOLDER>` can be usually found in `<SEQ_FOLDER>/mav0/camX/data`, where the X indicates if the left (0) or right (1) camera is used. The specific `<TIMESTAMPS_FILE>`, `<CALIB_FILE>` and `<SETTINGS_FILE>` for the EuRoC dataset are provided in `Examples/EurocData`.

The same executable can be used to run sequences from the TUM-VI dataset.

### 3.3 Video Example
It is also possible to run your own custom videos with known camera calibration. Run the executable as

```sh
./VideoExample <VIDEO_FILE> <CALIB_FILE> <SETTINGS_FILE>
```

where

   * `<VIDEO_FILE>` Custom video file with a supported format by OpenCV.
